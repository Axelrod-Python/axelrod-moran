## Evolution Reinforces Cooperation with the Emergence of Self-Recognition Mechanisms: an empirical study of the Moran process for the iterated Prisoner's dilemma

To the editors,

This paper presents a numerical study of the Moran process (a model of
evolutionary processes) for the iterated
Prisoner's dilemma.

We feel that it is an excellent fit for IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary
Computation. It exposes experimental results
carried out with the highest standard of reproducibility: all parameters and
algorithms are not only well described but they are also all open source,
archived and made available online.

Furthermore, the work is not only an original application of evolutionary
algorithms to train policies for a decision process but the decision process
itself is an evolutionary process: the Moran process.

It offers a strong contribution on two fronts:

- It is the largest such study of the Moran process with 164 strategies pitted
  against each other to create a ranking based on their ability to survive in an
  evolutionary setting.
- It offers clear and original evidence as to the strength of sophisticated
  strategies trained using reinforcement learning.

This latter point is perhaps of most significance as a lot of theoretic work
(described in the literature) focuses on the notion that strategies must be
simple to prevail.

Our work not only shows the limitations of this paradigm but also highlights
clear characteristics for evolutionary prosperity:

- Strategies able to resist invasion develop, through training, a handshake
  mechanism that allows them to recognise their opponents;
- Strategies that are strong invaders are the result of training aiming to
  optimise for overall score;


Thank you for taking the time to consider our work,
