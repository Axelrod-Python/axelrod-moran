	abstract = {The Prisoner's Dilemma is the leading metaphor for the evolution of cooperative behaviour in populations of selfish agents, especially since the well-known computer tournaments of Axelrod and their application to biological communities. In Axelrod's simulations, the simple strategy tit-for-tat did outstandingly well and subsequently became the major paradigm for reciprocal altruism. Here we present extended evolutionary simulations of heterogeneous ensembles of probabilistic strategies including mutation and selection, and report the unexpected success of another protagonist: Pavlov. This strategy is as simple as tit-for-tat and embodies the fundamental behavioural mechanism win-stay, lose-shift, which seems to be a widespread rule. Pavlov's success is based on two important advantages over tit-for-tat: it can correct occasional mistakes and exploit unconditional cooperators. This second feature prevents Pavlov populations from being undermined by unconditional cooperators, which in turn invite defectors. Pavlov seems to be more robust than tit-for-tat, suggesting that cooperative behaviour in natural situations may often be based on win-stay, lose-shift.},

	abstract = {The two-player Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game is a model for both sentient and evolutionary behaviors, especially including the emergence of cooperation. It is generally assumed that there exists no simple ultimatum strategy whereby one player can enforce a unilateral claim to an unfair share of rewards. Here, we show that such strategies unexpectedly do exist. In particular, a player X who is witting of these strategies can (i) deterministically set her opponent Y's score, independently of his strategy or response, or (ii) enforce an extortionate linear relation between her and his scores. Against such a player, an evolutionary player's best response is to accede to the extortion. Only a player with a theory of mind about his opponent can do better, in which case Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is an Ultimatum Game.},

@article{Li2009,
 abstract = {In recent iterated prisoner's dilemma tournaments, the most
             successful strategies were those that had identification
             mechanisms. By playing a predetermined sequence of moves and
             learning from their opponents' responses, these strategies managed
             to identify their opponents. We believe that these identification
             mechanisms may be very useful in evolutionary games. In this paper
             one such strategy, which we call collective strategy, is analyzed.
             Collective strategies apply a simple but efficient identification
             mechanism (that just distinguishes themselves from other
             strategies), and this mechanism allows them to only cooperate with
             their group members and defect against any others. In this way,
             collective strategies are able to maintain a stable population in
             evolutionary iterated prisoner's dilemma. By means of an invasion
             barrier, this strategy is compared with other strategies in
             evolutionary dynamics in order to demonstrate its evolutionary
             features. We also find that this collective behavior assists the
             evolution of cooperation in specific evolutionary environments.},

Here we show that zero-determinant strategies are at most weakly dominant, are not evolutionarily stable, and will instead evolve into less coercive strategies. We show that zero-determinant strategies with an informational advantage over other players that allows them to recognize each other can be evolutionarily stable (and able to exploit other players). However, such an advantage is bound to be short-lived as opposing strategies evolve to counteract the recognition.},

                of the computer tournament for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.
                The object is to gain a deeper understanding of how to perform
                well in such a setting. The 62 entrants were able to draw
                lessons from the results of the first round and were able to
                design their entries to take these lessons into account. The
                results of the second round demonstrate a number of subtle
                pitfalls which specific types of decision rules can encounter.
                The winning rule was once again TIT FOR TAT, the rule which
                cooperates on the first move and then does what the other player
                did on the previous move. The analysis of the results shows the
                value of not being the first to defect, of being somewhat
                forgiving, but also the importance of being provocable. An
                analysis of hypothetical alternative tournaments demonstrates
                the robustness of the results.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of six experiments and analyses performed to explore the applicability of the non-constant-sum case of the theories of von Neumann-Morgenstern, and others, to the actual behavior of people playing games or involved in bargaining situations. The paper suggests directions in which the theory of games might be modified and extended to improve its applicability and usefulness. A "split-the-difference principle" is suggested to augment the usual theory, so as to specify the exact amount of payments to be made in an ordinary two-person bargaining situation such as the sale of a used car. The application of this principle seems satisfactory in the experiments. One experiment suggests that, in a sequence of trials in the same game situation, people tend to start near an equilibrium point and then try to find a better equilibrium, if there is one. The experiments show examples of non-optimal behavior of the bargainers when the judgment necessary to estimate the relevant payoff is obscure. A fair division of five parcels of objects among five players when each player attaches different values to the parcels is out-lined and computed, and the effect of coalitions is discussed.},

This is true, but the real wonder is the rise of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, communities, and the environment concomitant with their use. The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefitted from man's overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically, agriculturally, or otherwise. This review presents the salient aspects of antibiotic resistance development over the past half-century, with the oft-restated conclusion that it is time to act. To achieve complete restitution of therapeutic applications of antibiotics, there is a need for more information on the role of environmental microbiomes in the rise of antibiotic resistance. In particular, creative approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics and their expedited and controlled introduction to therapy are obligatory.},
