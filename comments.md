# Journal Requirements:

> 1. When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional
> requirements.

> Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements,
> including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at
> http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf
> and

TODO Ensure style file is followed?

> 2. Please remove your figures from within your manuscript file, leaving only
> the individual TIFF/EPS image files, uploaded separately.  These will be
> automatically included in the reviewers’ PDF.

TODO Remove images from file

# 5. Review Comments to the Author

> Reviewer #1: Using agent-based simulations, the authors investigated the
> performance of 164 game strategies of the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma with the
> Moran process in populations of different sizes. Strategies doing well for
> invasion and resistance were detected and their features were analyzed. It was
> found that the best invaders were those strategies trained to maximize total
> payoff while the best resistors had the handshake mechanism, which was a
> product of the evolutionary process. The work is interesting and the results
> are novel, as they may help us better understand the population dynamics and
> evaluate the performance of game strategies. Therefore, I suggest to accept the
> article if it can be improved based on several questions or suggestions mainly
> for making the paper more reader-friendly as follows:

> 1) The authors discussed about as many as 164 strategies, which were
> trained/generated via different algorithms. Since understanding how the
> strategies work plays an important role in understanding why some of them
> succeed, I strongly suggest the authors to introduce the strategies in a more
> detailed and clear way, especially those based on finite state machines as I
> find no reference of them yet some of them perform well in the comparisons.

TODO Add better overview of strategies.

> 2) During the training/screening process, strategies generated via different
> algorithms were trained according to different criteria to determine whether a
> strategy was well trained or not. As examples, some were trained to maximize
> their payoff while others were trained with the objective function of mean
> fixation probabilities of Moran processes. So I am curious about how different
> criteria influence the features of the strategies? Will the conclusion of this
> work change if some strategies are trained in terms of other criteria?

TODO Add conclusion sentence highlighting the difference between the training
mechanisms

> 3) The concept ‘handshake mechanism’ is essential to appreciate the results as
> well as conclusion of this work but is not well defined, hence I suggest the
> authors to explain this concept clearly.

TODO Add description of the handshake mechanism to the intro

> 4) In line 241-242, it looks weird that there is a new paragraph starting in
> the middle of the sentence ‘The top 16 (10%) strategies are shown in Table 4
> and figures …’.

TODO Fix this? Possibly related to the removal of images

> 5) There are not a few phrases and sentences that may make the readers
> confusing. One example is ‘This is also the N for which …” in line 256.

TODO Go through and clarify all sentences.

> Reviewer #2: This manuscript provides a detailed numerical analysis of
> agent-based simulations of 164 complex and adaptive strategies for the IPD,
> using an online GitHub library. The authors presented a lot of insights and
> empirical results. In my opinion, this paper is excellent, and worth publishing
> in the present form.
