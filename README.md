# axelrod-moran

Requires Python 3 or an installation of [pathlib](https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/pathlib2)

Usage:

```bash
python moran.py <population-size> <repetitions: default 1000>
```

There is also a script `execute.sh` that will run the above for population sizes
2 through 12 (will take a _long_ time).
